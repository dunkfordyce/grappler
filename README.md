Grappler
========

Grappler is a minimalistic server for "comet" and TCP connections that exposes a single, consistent API across all transports.
Grappler currently supports the following transports (each with a list of currently supported browsers):

- WebSockets (with Flash policy support -- watches for policy requests on the same port as the grappler server)
  - Firefox 4, Chrome 4, Safari 5, or any browser that supports at least Flash 9.x
- XHR Long Polling
  - Any browser that supports XMLHttpRequest*
- XHR Multipart Streaming
  - Firefox 3
- Server-Sent Events
  - Chrome 6, Safari 5, Opera 9.x-10.x (DOM only)
- Plain TCP connections (Not yet implemented)

* - Some browsers' XMLHttpRequest implementations contain unexpected quirks (i.e. the built-in web browser for Android 1.6)

Requirements
============

- Node.JS v0.1.100+
- A client supporting one of the aforementioned transports.
- For HTTP (non-WebSocket) clients, cookies must be enabled for clients ONLY if they are going to send messages (i.e. via POST) to the server.

Example
=======

Run example/server.js.

API
===

Grappler exports a few objects, with the main object being: `Server`.
The others include the `LOG` and `STATE` objects, which contain constants used for when logging messages and representing the state of a client respectively.

The `LOG` object is:
    {
	  INFO: 1,
	  WARN: 2,
	  ERROR: 3
    }

The `STATE` object is:
    {
	  ACCEPTED: 1, // internal use only
	  TEMP: 2, // internal use only
	  PROTO_HTTP: 4, // client is HTTP-based
	  PROTO_WEBSOCKET: 8, // client is WebSocket-based
	  PROTO_TCP: 16 // client is plain TCP-based
	}

## Server

### Constructor: new Server([options], [fnHandleNormalHTTP], [fnAcceptClient])

Creates a new instance of a grappler server.

`options` is an object with the following default values:
    {
      // A callback for receiving "debug" information. It is called with two arguments: message and message level.
	  // Message level is one of the values in the `LOG` object.
      logger: function(msg, msgLevel) {},

	  // A string or array of strings which denote who is allowed to connect to this grappler Server instance.
	  // The format of the string is: "hostname:port", "hostname", or an asterisk substituted for either the hostname
	  // or port, or both, to act as a wildcard.
	  origins: "*:*",
	  
	  // An integer value in milliseconds representing the interval in which a ping is sent to an HTTP client for those
	  // transports that need to do so.
	  pingInterval: 3000
	}

`fnHandleNormalHTTP` is a callback which is able to override grappler for an incoming HTTP connection.
If no headers are sent, then grappler takes control of the connection. The arguments provided to this callback are the
same for `http.Server`'s `request` event, that is the http.ServerRequest and http.ServerResponse objects. It should be
noted that if you want grappler to automatically handle all incoming HTTP connections but want to specify a callback
for `fnAcceptClient`, you need to specify `null` or `false` for `fnHandleNormalHTTP`.

`fnAcceptClient` is a callback that is executed the moment a client connects (even before they are deemed an HTTP or plain TCP
client). The main purpose of this callback is to have the chance to immediately deny a client further access to the grappler server.
For example, your application may maintain a blacklist or may automatically blacklist/throttle back a certain IP after x connections in y time.
If this callback returns false, the connection will automatically be dropped, otherwise the connection will be permitted.
The callback receives one argument, which is the `net.Stream` object representing the connection.

### Event: connection

`function(client) { }`

This event is emitted every time a new client has successfully connected to the system.
`client` is an instance of `Client`.

### Event: data

`function(data, client) { }`

This event is emitted when a client sends data to the server.
`data` is a Buffer containing the data and `client` is the `Client` who sent it.

### Event: error

`function(err) { }`

Emitted when an unexpected error occurs.

### listen(port, [host])

Starts the server listening on the specified `port` and `host`. If `host` is omitted, the server will listen on any IP address.

### broadcast(data)

Sends `data` to every connected client.

### shutdown()

Shuts down the server by no longer listening for incoming connections and severing any existing client connections.


## Client

There is one other important object that is used in grappler, and that is the `Client` object.
`Client` represents a user connected to the server and can be used to send that user data.

### Event: drain

`function() { }`

Emitted when the client's write buffer becomes empty.

### Event: close

`function() { }`

Emitted when the client has disconnected.

### state

A bit field containing the current state of the client. See the aforementioned `STATE` object for valid bits.

### remoteAddress

The IP address of the client.

### write(data, [encoding])

Sends `data` using an optional encoding to the client.
This function returns `true` if the entire data was flushed successfully to the kernel
buffer. Otherwise, it will return `false` if all or part of the data was queued in user memory.
`drain` will be emitted when the kernel buffer is free again.

### broadcast(data)

Sends `data` to every connected client except itself.

### disconnect()

Forcefully severs the client's connection to the server.
